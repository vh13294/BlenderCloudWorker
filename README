BlenderCloud worker


Life cycle of workers

● Worker instances are created from an instancetemplate image, which has all the required programs and dependencies installed

● Workers have to create a connection with the GCS bucket to ensure access to the blend file to be rendered as well as output the rendered images.

● Other low-level startup tasks are processed, for example, acquiring the instances internal IP address for identification when communicating between instances

● Task is received from the manager via HTTP request using internal IP address, offering ultra low latency

● Task is executed, running a python script that reports back to the manager the current status of the machine and the progress of the render over a socket.io listen server

● Once the task has been processed the worker will report to the manager and terminate itself
