strong-build\n\nBuild a node application package, preparing it for deploy to production.\n\nIt is useful standalone, but is commonly used to build applications for\ndeployment to the StrongLoop process manager, strong-pm.\n\nFor more details, see http://strong-pm.io.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n`sl-build` is made available through the\n[strongloop](https://github.com/strongloop/strongloop) tool as `slc build`, and\nworks well with the StrongLoop Process Manager,\n[strong-pm](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-pm).\n\n`sl-build` can be installed standalone with:\n\n    npm install -g strong-build\n\n\n## Overview\n\nThe purpose of building a node application is to bundle its dependencies so\nthat there:\n\n- are no deploy-time dependencies on external services\n- it is in a deployable format\n\nThe build process is implemented as four commands:\n\n- `sl-build --install`: the core of the build, it installs dependencies, runs custom\n  build steps, and prunes development dependencies\n- `sl-build --bundle`: modify the npm `package.json` and `.npmignore` configuration files\n  so dependencies will be packed\n- `sl-build --pack`: create an npm package of the build\n- `sl-build --commit`: commit the build onto a git branch\n\nThe default behaviour of `sl-build` depends on whether the current directory is\na git repository.\n\n- In a git repository: the default is `sl-build --install --commit`, to build\n  onto a git branch.\n- Otherwise: the default is `sl-build --bundle --install --pack`, to build an\n  npm package.\n\nBoth npm packages and git branches can be deployed to the StrongLoop [process\nmanager](http://github.com/strongloop/strong-pm) using the StrongLoop\n[deploy](http://github.com/strongloop/strong-deploy) tool.\n\nSpecifying any command disables the default, and allows any mix of commands\nto be run, either singly, or all at once.\n\nAlso, note that *builds should be done in a clean working copy*. You don't\nbuild deployment artifacts out of a possibly dirty working copy if you want\nreproducible builds. You can clean your working copy using `git clean -x -d\n-f`. This is too destructive for the build tool to do, but doing a build in an\nunclean working repository may trigger an error in a future version of the\ntool.\n\n\n## install command\n\nInstallation automates the common work flow for building application\ndependencies:\n\n- `npm install --ignore-scripts`: Install dependencies without running scripts.\n  Scripts can be run optionally with `--scripts`.\n- `npm run build`: Custom build steps such as `grunt build` or `bower` can be\n  specified in the package's `scripts.build` property, since front-end code\n  served by node commonly requires some amount of preparation.\n- `npm prune --production`: Remove development-only tools (such as bower, or\n  grunt) that may have been required by the package's build scripts, but should\n  not be deployed.\n\nNote that compilation and install scripts should be run on the deployment\nserver using:\n\n- `npm rebuild`: Compile add-ons for current system.\n- `npm install`: Run any install scripts (not typical, but if they exist they\n  may be required to prepare the application for running).\n\nIf builds are done on the same system architecture as the deploy, it is\npossible to compile and package the add-ons, and avoid the presence of a\ncompiler on the deployment system. This is recommended when possible, but is\nnot the default assumption of strong-build.\n\n\n## bundle command\n\nBundling configures the package.json and .npmignore so deployment (not\ndevelopment) dependencies as well as any 'build' script output will not be\nignored by `npm pack`.\n\nThis is unnecessary when using git to deploy, but mandatory when creating npm\npackages!\n\n### package.bundleDependencies\n\nBundling requires that the  `bundleDependencies` property in the `package.json`\nfile is configured to include all non-development dependencies, including\noptional dependencies, which are often overlooked.\n\nIts important that you remember to add every new production dependency to the\n`bundleDependencies` property, if you don't, npm will try and install them\nafter deploy, creating unexpected and fragile dependencies on npmjs.org.\n\nSince keeping this up-to-date manually is likely to go wrong, we recommend\nallowing the bundle command to do this for you. However, the\n`bundleDependencies` property is not modified if present, so you are free to\nmaintain it yourself, if you wish (or to not just the bundle command).\n\n### .npmignore\n\nSetting bundle dependencies is insufficient to get the output of build tools.\n\nBoth build output and project ephemera such as test output is usually ignored\nusing `.gitignore`, as it should be. However, if npm does not find a\n`.npmignore` configuration file, it uses `.gitignore` as a fallback.  This means\nthat if you have custom build output, such as minimized JavaScript, it will be\ntreated as project ephemera, and not be packed by npm.\n\nThe bundle command will create an *empty* `.npmignore` file if there is a\n`.gitignore` file but there is no `.npmignore` file. This will work for clean\nrepositories, but if you have any project ephemera, they will get packed.\n\nWe recommend you write and maintain you own `.npmignore` file unless your build\nprocess guarantees a clean working repository.\n\n\n## pack command\n\nPack output is a tar file in the format produced by `npm pack` and\naccepted by `npm install` and\n[strong-deploy](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-deploy).\n\nThe pack file is placed in the parent directory of the application being packed,\nto avoid the pack file itself getting packed by future builds, and to allow the\nworking repository to be cleaned.\n\nIf a `.npmignore` file was created by the bundle command, check the pack file\ncontents carefully to ensure build products are packed, but project ephemera are\nnot.\n\n\n## commit command\n\nCommitting build products into git provides the most robust tracking and\nstorage, including versioning of deployments.\n\nThis is often done by committing both build products and dependencies\n(`node_modules`) into git where they pollute the source branches, create massive\ngit commits and huge churn on the development branches and repositories.\n\nThe commit command does not do this.\n\nIt commits an exact replica of current branch source and build products onto a\ndeployment branch. After the commit, the deployment branch tip shows as a merge\nof the deployment and source branches.  This allows a complete history of\ndeployment builds to be kept in git, but separated from the development\nbranches. Deployment branches can be pushed to the same repository as the\ndevelopment branches, or not.\n\nNote that branches prepared like this can also be pushed to platforms such\nas OpenShift and Heroku.\n\nThe default name of the deployment branch is \"deploy\", but is configurable with\nthe `--onto BRANCH` modifier to the commit command.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nusage: sl-build [options]\n\nBuild a node application package.\n\nWith no options, the default depends on whether a git repository is\ndetected or not.\n\nIf a git repository is detected the default is `--git`: install and commit the\nbuild results to the \"deploy\" branch, which will be created if it does not\nalready exist.\n\nIf no git repository is detected the default is `--npm`: bundle, install, and\npack the build results into a `<package-name>-<version>.tgz` file.\n\nOptions:\n  -h,--help       Print this message and exit.\n  -v,--version    Print version and exit.\n  -n,--npm        Same as `--install --bundle --pack`.\n  -g,--git        Same as `--install --commit`.\n  -i,--install    Install dependencies (without scripts, by default).\n  --scripts       If installing, run scripts (to build addons).\n  -b,--bundle     Modify package to bundle deployment dependencies.\n  -p,--pack       Pack into a publishable archive (with dependencies).\n\nGit specific options:\n  -c,--commit     Commit build output (branch specified by --onto).\n  --onto BRANCH   Branch to commit build results to, created if\n                  necessary (\"deploy\", by default).\n```\n\n## License\n\nstrong-build uses a dual license model.\n\nYou may use this library under the terms of the [Artistic 2.0 license][],\nor under the terms of the [StrongLoop Subscription Agreement][].\n\n[Artistic 2.0 license]: http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-2.0\n[StrongLoop Subscription Agreement]: http://strongloop.com/license\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bajtos","email":"mbajtoss@gmail.com"},{"name":"chandadharap","email":"chanda_dharap@yahoo.com"},{"name":"ibmcloud-admin","email":"rmg@ca.ibm.com"},{"name":"kraman","email":"kraman@gmail.com"},{"name":"octet","email":"vieuxtech@gmail.com"},{"name":"rfeng","email":"enjoyjava@gmail.com"},{"name":"ritch","email":"skawful@gmail.com"},{"name":"rmg","email":"r.m.graham@gmail.com"},{"name":"setogit","email":"setogit@gmail.com"},{"name":"strongloop","email":"strngops@us.ibm.com"},{"name":"superkhau","email":"superkhau@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-10T08:51:32.962Z","created":"2014-06-19T19:46:35.820Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-19T19:46:35.820Z","0.1.0":"2014-06-19T20:01:33.321Z","0.1.1":"2014-07-22T03:43:34.031Z","0.1.2":"2014-07-22T19:17:02.790Z","0.2.0":"2014-08-28T19:02:37.635Z","0.2.1":"2014-09-03T03:32:25.893Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-02T21:38:19.995Z","1.0.1-2":"2014-11-03T20:37:42.784Z","1.0.2":"2014-12-09T19:52:29.957Z","1.0.3":"2015-01-13T04:03:51.490Z","2.0.0":"2015-04-30T22:30:07.735Z","2.0.1":"2015-05-13T18:28:22.235Z","2.0.2":"2015-05-21T22:38:35.401Z","2.0.3":"2015-07-07T22:14:45.748Z","2.0.4":"2015-08-06T21:38:43.425Z","2.0.5":"2015-09-16T14:41:35.099Z","2.0.6":"2015-10-01T16:38:42.565Z","2.1.0":"2015-12-21T19:24:08.454Z","2.1.1":"2016-04-11T21:48:28.606Z","2.1.2":"2016-05-06T04:56:09.623Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/strongloop/strong-build#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/strongloop/strong-build.git"},"author":{"name":"engineering@strongloop.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/strongloop/strong-build/issues"},"license":"Artistic-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["StrongLoop","build","bundle","dependencies","git","heroku","npm","openshift","slc"],"users":{"ekstergans":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"57aaeb14-9d50\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 08:51:32 GMT","_cached":true}
