Every method that\nreceives a callback is called using an error first callback. But this is not the\ncase with servers. When you tell the server to start listening on the given port\nit can will `emit` an `error` event when it failed.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install connected --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar connected = require('connected')\n  , http = require('http');\n\nvar app = http.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  res.end('wobble wobble');\n});\n\nconnected(app, 80, function (err) {\n  // Received an error because we are not allowed to listen on port 80\n});\n```\n\nAnd thats it.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"v1","email":"info@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-28T21:55:55.235Z","created":"2013-05-25T12:31:06.119Z","0.0.0":"2013-05-25T12:31:07.938Z","0.0.1":"2014-06-24T10:49:43.221Z","0.0.2":"2014-07-04T09:37:29.207Z"},"author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:3rd-Eden/connected.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/connected","keywords":["connected","connect","listen","listening","error","online","up","up","and","away"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/connected/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"54c95aeb-1104\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:55:55 GMT"}
