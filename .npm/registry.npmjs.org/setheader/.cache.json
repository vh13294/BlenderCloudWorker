setHeader\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/setHeader.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/3rd-Eden/setHeader)\n\nThis module is an alternate way of setting headers in your node applications.\nNode doesn't have any protection or ways to prevent your previously set headers\nfrom being overridden. So just because you set a `X-Powered-By` or\n`X-Frame-Options` header it doesn't mean that this exact header will eventually\nbe written to the response. It could be that you have a middleware layer that\nsilently modified the header. This module attempts to prevent that from\nhappening by making the set property `readOnly`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save setheader\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following snippet should make it clear:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar setHeader = require('setheader');\n\n//\n// Create a basic http server just to illustrate the example usage here..\n//\nrequire('http').createServer(function (req, res) {\n  setHeader(res, 'X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');\n\n  res.end('(\\/)(;,,;)(\\/)');\n}).listen(8080);\n```\n\nAs you can see in the example above the `setHeader` method receives **3**\nrequired arguments:\n\n1. `res`, The HTTP Response instance of your HTTP server server.\n2. `name`, The name of the header it needs to set.\n3. `value`, The value of the header that is set.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"v1","email":"info@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-28T22:04:39.883Z","created":"2014-03-07T09:03:26.834Z","0.0.0":"2014-03-07T09:03:26.834Z","0.0.1":"2014-03-07T09:15:11.814Z","0.0.2":"2014-03-07T09:47:29.260Z","0.0.3":"2014-03-07T13:55:28.045Z","0.0.4":"2014-03-18T23:14:03.439Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/setHeader","keywords":["setHeader","headers","sticky-headers","protected-header","protect"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/setHeader"},"author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/3rd-Eden/setHeader/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"54c95cf7-1b8b\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 22:04:39 GMT"}
