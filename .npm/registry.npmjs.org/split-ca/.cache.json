Simply give split-ca the filepath of your bundle file.\n\n```js\nvar https = require('https');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nvar splitca = require('split-ca');\n\nvar options = {\n  ca: splitca(\"path/to/ca_bundle_file\"),\n  key:fs.readFileSync(\"path/to/server_key_file\"),\n  cert:fs.readFileSync(\"path/to/server_cert_file\"),\n  requestCert: true,\n  rejectUnauthorized: true\n};\n\nhttps.createServer(options, function (req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end(\"hello world\\n\");\n}).listen(8000);\n```\n\n## Args\n\n`split-ca('filepath','split-string','encoding')`\n\n#### `filepath`\n\nA standard node path to your object.  An error is thrown if the file cannot be parsed, is not formatted properly.\n\n#### `split-string`\n\nOptional.  Defaults to `\"\\n\"`, can be replaced with anything.\n\n#### `encoding`\n\nOptional.  Defaults to `\"utf-8\"`, can be replaced with anything accepted by node's `fs` module.\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to [Benjie Gillam](https://twitter.com/Benjie) for the [blog post and sample code](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2012/06/node-dot-js-ssl-certificate-chain/) that was unashamedly ripped for this module.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bushong1","email":"bushong1@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-01T18:08:07.407Z","created":"2015-02-01T17:35:36.761Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-01T17:35:36.761Z","1.0.1":"2016-03-01T18:08:07.407Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bushong1/split-ca","keywords":["nodejs","ca","chain","ssl","tls","https","certificate","authority","bundle","ca-bundle","ca-chain","split","server"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/bushong1/split-ca.git"},"author":{"name":"Charles Bushong"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bushong1/split-ca/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"bushong1":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"56d5da87-1321\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 18:08:07 GMT"}
