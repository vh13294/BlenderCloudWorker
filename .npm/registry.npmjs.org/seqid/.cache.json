It is inspired by TCP sequencing, such that it will just generate integer sequential ids.\n\nThe ids generated are signed integers, I.e. if the id being generated would ever exceed 2147483648 it rolls over to -2147483647 and continues.\n\nThis means you can get repeated ids if you generate enough.\n\nThe ideal use-case for this tool is generating ephemeral ids for communication or coordination or matching.\n\n```javascript\nvar SeqId = require(\"seqid\")\n\nvar id = SeqId(0)\nconsole.log(id.next()) // 1\nconsole.log(id.next()) // 2\n```\n\nAPI\n===\n\n`var id = require(\"seqid\")([initial])`\n---\n\nCreate the id generator with optional `initial` value. Otherwise it will generate a random initial value.\n\n`id.next()`\n---\n\nGet the next value in sequence. It will always be a signed integer.\n\nLICENSE\n=======\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bryce","email":"bryce@ravenwall.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-19T18:01:14.880Z","created":"2014-08-16T16:47:27.520Z","1.0.0":"2014-08-16T16:47:27.520Z","1.0.1":"2014-08-19T18:01:14.880Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/brycebaril/seqid","keywords":["id","squence"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:brycebaril/seqid.git"},"author":{"name":"Bryce B.
