extensive UTF-8 validation in order to conform to\nthe specification. This was unfortunately not possible in JavaScript, hence the\nneed for a binary addon.\n\nAs the module consists of binary components, it should be used as\n`optionalDependency` so when installation fails, it doesn't halt the\ninstallation of your module. There are fallback files available in this\nrepository. See `fallback.js` for the suggest fallback implementation if\ninstallation fails.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install utf-8-validate\n```\n\n## API\n\nIn all examples we assume that you've already required the mdoule as\nfollows:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar validation = require('utf-8-validate').Validation;\n```\n\nThe module exposes 1 function:\n\n#### isValidUTF8\n\nValidate if the passed in buffer contains valid UTF-8 chars.\n\n```js\nvalidation.isValidUTF8(buffer);\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},{"name":"einaros","email":"einaros@gmail.com"},{"name":"lpinca","email":"luigipinca@gmail.com"},{"name":"v1","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-12-08T15:19:55.026Z","created":"2015-01-28T08:38:29.614Z","1.0.0":"2015-01-28T08:38:29.614Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-29T10:05:31.659Z","1.1.0":"2015-05-05T19:37:11.971Z","1.2.0":"2015-08-13T12:14:09.977Z","1.2.1":"2015-08-21T11:38:43.101Z","1.2.2":"2016-12-07T16:35:10.571Z","2.0.0":"2016-12-08T15:19:55.026Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate","keywords":["utf-8-validate"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate.git"},"author":{"name":"Einar Otto Stangvik","email":"einaros@gmail.com","url":"http://2x.io"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/websockets/utf-8-validate/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hiwanz":true,"apihlaja":true,"mojaray2k":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"58497a1b-2c4b\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 15:19:55 GMT","_cached":true}
