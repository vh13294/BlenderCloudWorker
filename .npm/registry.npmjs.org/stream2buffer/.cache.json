Stream to Buffer\n\nConcatenate a readable stream's data into a single buffer.\n\nIt will concatenate a raw stream to a `Buffer`, an ascii or utf8\nencoded stream to a `String`, and an object mode stream to an\n`Array`.\n\n## Installing\n\n    npm install --save stream2buffer\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar stream2Buffer = require('stream2buffer');\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar Readable = require('stream').Readable;\nvar assert = require('assert');\n\n// Raw stream\nvar rawStream = fs.createReadStream('hamlet.txt');\nstream2Buffer(rawStream, function (err, buffer) {\n  assert.ok(buffer instanceof Buffer);\n  assert.ok(Buffer.isBuffer(buffer));\n});\n\n// utf8 encoded stream\nvar encodedStream = fs.createReadStream('hamlet.txt', {\n  encoding: 'utf8' // would be the same with ascii here\n});\nstream2Buffer(encodedStream, function (err, buffer) {\n  assert.ok(typeof buffer === 'string');\n});\n\n// object mode stream\nvar objectStream = new Readable({ objectMode: true });\nvar n = 10;\nobjectStream._read = function _read () {\n  objectStream.push({ \"hello\": \"world\" });\n  if (!n--)\n    objectStream.push(null);\n};\nstream2Buffer(objectStream, function (err, buffer) {\n  assert.ok(buffer instanceof Array);\n  assert.ok(Array.isArray(buffer));\n});\n```\n\n## A fork of\n\n[Jonathan Ong](https://github.com/jonathanong)'s [`stream-to-buffer`](https://github.com/jonathanong/stream-to-buffer/tree/10874042b9c5c1c447889c028fa078a40eed830d).\nI forked it because we disagree on how much [`stream-to-buffer` must\nknow](https://github.com/jonathanong/stream-to-buffer/pull/2)\nto work properly.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is
